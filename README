Architecture of Solutions:

       Pnmtrans uses pnm.h to read in ppm files, which it does using a2methods,
       an abstraction for functions (defined in a2blocked and a2plain) to 
       manipulate a 2D array. The 2D array will either be represented as an 
       UArray2b_T or UArray2_T. The functions in a2blocked and a2plain are
       functions in UArray2b and UArray2, respectively, but hidden from the 
       client. Pnmtrans also uses cputiming to keep track of the time taken
       for each manipulation.

Patterns found throughout testing various images:
         - time taken for rotating 0 and rotating 180 row major was about
           half the time taken for rotating 0 and rotating 180 block major
         - col major took the longest for 0 and 180 rotations
         - block major took the longest for rotate 90
         - col major always takes longer than row major, much longer for rotate
           0 and rotate 180 and only a little bit longer for rotate 90
         - time per pixel and instructions per pixel are always the same no 
           matter the size of the image
         - relative to the differences in time between different rotations done
           row and col major, block major time taken to rotate different degrees
           is relatively similar, though still shortest for rotate 0 and longest
           for rotate 180

    When mapping by block, there will always be about the same hit rate no
    matter the type. This is due to the same number of columns and rows being 
    loaded in a block. The differences in times for different rotations are
    due to minor differences in the number of operations done per pixel. Row
    major performs much better for rotate 0 and rotate 180 and col major
    performs much better for rotate 90 because needed elements will more likely
    already be in the cache for these respective manipulations.
